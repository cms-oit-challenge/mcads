# MCADS Design Exercise Sample Data

This repository contains several sample data sets for use in developing and testing design challenge submissions.
This sample data contains no PII or PHI; it is entirely synthetic.

This sample data has several limitations that submitters should keep in mind:

* It is not exhaustive:
    submitters should assume that their submissions will be evaluated using other data not made available here.
* It is small:
    submitters should assume that their submissions will be evaluated against data sets larger than those here.
* It is not representative of the MCADS program itself.
  It is derived from synthetic medical claims, not dental claims.
  It contains a small fraction of the number and breadth of fields that real claims processing systems contain.
